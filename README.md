# project information
Gelly
temporal graph
temporal shortest path

# Setup
After you've pulled the project let maven import the projects dependancies and simply run the file examples/analyze_rita.java
This should run and give you some results.

# example

# background
I made Tink in 2017 for my master thesis for graduation computer science and engineering at the Eindhoven University of Technology. I will present Tink at the Flink forward conference in september 2017 in Berlin

# roadmap
* Configure Maven in such a way that Flink doesn't has to be pulled as a library
* Complete all the comments
* Clean up the project with the testing code
